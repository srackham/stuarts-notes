This didactic Todo app was written to illustrate the [Flux](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2014/05/06/flux.html) DSV (Dispatch Store View) design pattern.

**[Version 1.0.0](https://github.com/srackham/flux-backbone-todo/tree/1.0.0)** (14 November 2014).

This post is a copy of the [Github project](https://github.com/srackham/flux-backbone-todo) README.

Flux is a design pattern for building scaleable applications using a Unidirectional Data Flow (it is not a Web development framework), the Flux library implements a Dispatcher which works well with the Flux design pattern.

The Todo app is implemented using [Flux](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2014/05/06/flux.html), [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) and [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html).

## Architecture and Implementation

The Flux/React combination results in a highly decoupled declarative application structure. Here is the actual code:
    
    var dispatcher = new Flux.Dispatcher();
    var todoStore = new TodoStore([], {dispatcher: dispatcher});
     
    React.render(
        <div>
          <h3>Todos</h3>
          <TodoFormComponent store={todoStore} />
          <TodoListComponent store={todoStore} />
          <p>
          Want a second fully synchronized list? Just declare another list component: no code required,
          no events to wire up!
          </p>
          <TodoListComponent store={todoStore} />
        </div>,
        document.getElementById('app')
    );


 

Just declare the Dispatcher, Store and View and you're done. The Flux unidirectional _Dispatcher->Store->View_ dependencies are obvious.

  * The `todoStore` is passed the `dispatcher` (as a constructor argument) when it is instantiated. 
  * UI components that display or update the Todo list are passed the `todoStore` (as a property) when they are instantiated. 

Displaying a second fully synchronized Todo list is a bit nonsensical but it graphically illustrates the power of the Flux architecture -- try doing this in any other framework.

## Data flow

Data flows unidirectionally in a circular path _Dispatcher->Store->View->Dispatcher-> â€¦_:

  * The `todoStore` listens for `dispatcher` actions (messages) and updates itself in response to these messages. 
  * UI components listen for Backbone events from the `todoStore` informing them of changes to the store that need to be displayed in the UI. 
  * UI components send actions (messages) to the `dispatcher` in response to user input -- components do not mutate the store directly. 

## The Store

  * The store is a Black Box containing the application's state and the logic to execute dispatcher actions which update (mutate) the store. 
  * Externally there is no way to mutate the store other than indirectly via dispatcher actions. 
  * The store emits change events to subscribers (UI view components). 
  * The store has no knowledge of its external environment. 

Backbone is used to implement a pub/sub data store for the Todos list with Backbone Models and Collections (Backbone is not used as a development framework). Backbone unburdens the app from having to implement a pub/sub event emitter for the store (as well as providing a rich model/collection API).

Storing the component state in a mutative Backbone store instead of using an immutable component `State` object means we need to use the React [forceUpdate](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-api.html#forceupdate) API which could have performance implications for complex React UIs. See this [excellent discussion](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21709905/can-i-avoid-forceupdate-when-using-react-with-backbone) explains the issue and, if necessary, strategies to resolve it.  React does a great job of DOM update optimization so I would stick with the simplicity of using `forceUpdate` until confronted with a real use-case to the contrary.

`TodoStore` collection and `TodoItem` models are passed a Flux dispatcher when they are instantiated. `TodoItem` models are instantiated by the Backbone Collection `add` method which passes the dispatcher option to the `TodoItem` model's `initialize` function.

## Building and Running

The app is developed and built in a node/npm environment. To install and run:

  1. Make sure you have node and npm installed. 
  2. Clone the Github repo: 
    
        git clone https://github.com/srackham/flux-backbone-todo.git


 
  3. Install npm dependencies: 
    
        cd flux-backbone-todo
        npm install


 
  4. Build the app `app/bundle.js` bundle (although JQuery is not required by Backbone I had to include it to satisfy webpack which thought it was a dependency): 
    
        webpack


 
  5. Start the app in a server: 
    
        npm start


 
  6. Open your Web browser at [http://localhost:8888/](http://localhost:8888/). 

## Lessons learnt

  * As always in JavaScript, when you pass a callback you need to ensure that they are bound to the correct context. In the following example the Backbone Model event handler's context is bound to the current object: 
    
        this.props.store.on('change',
            function() {
              this.forceUpdate();
            }.bind(this)
        );


 
  * When binding you need to take caller and callee arguments into consideration. The previous example can be simplified by passing `forceUpdate` as the change handler callback, but if you do not remember to explicitly bind the `forceUpdate` first argument to `null` the program will throw an error because `forceUpdate` would be called by the Backbone event dispatcher with a first argument that is not a callback (namely the changed Backbone model): 
    
        this.props.store.on('change',
          this.forceUpdate.bind(this, null)
        );


 
  * Backbone Model attributes are not model properties -- access them with `get()` and `set()` not with the dot syntax. 
  * I spent far to much time debugging what is a very simple application, most of the time could have been saved if I had been using a language with type checking -- _ES6 + JSX + type annotations + type checking_  would be nice (this is a criticism of JavaScript in general, not of the application architecture or the tools).
