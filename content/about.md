These posts are mostly just notes I've made while exploring new computer
technologies and applications.

The blog has went into hiatus in 2015. In 2018 I ported it from
[Hugo](http://hugo.spf13.com) to
[hindsite](http://github.com/srackham/hindsite). Prior to 2015 it was hosted by
Wordpress.

I have not enabled blog post comments, if you feel compelled you can leave a
