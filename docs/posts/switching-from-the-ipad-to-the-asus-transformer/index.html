<p>My blogs are usually technical in content and try to be objective in character, this blog is a bit different, it has an unashamed subjective bias (you&rsquo;ve been warned).</p>

<p>Shortly after the iPad 2 was released I went over to the Dark Side and brought one (my first and only Apple computer). I was just fed up waiting for a decent Android tablet. At the time my only requirements were a decent ePub reader and a web browser.</p>

<p>After two months with the iPad I was still hankering for an Android tablet, I know this probably sounds a bit wishy-washy, but  although I used it every day I never really bonded with the iPad, it always felt like an appliance, a black box, something that you turn on, use, then turn off.  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the iPad 2 is a nice piece hardware, it&rsquo;s easy to pick up and use and the software does what it was designed to do.  The best recommendation I can give the iPad is that it works.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago I bit the Android bullet and tossed up between an Asus Transformer and a Samsung 10.1 tablet.  The Transformer won and I brought the 32GB model with keyboard dock. When I say &ldquo;tossed up&rdquo; I am being a little flippant &ndash; I compared specs, read reviews and got to play with a Transformer (I had been leaning towards the iPad-like Samsung 10.1 but the hands-on convinced me that the Transformer was a nice piece of kit and that the keyboard was going to be very useful). The transformer&rsquo;s cheaper price was also a plus.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t touched my iPad since I got the Transformer, the more I use the Transformer it the more I like it (there&rsquo;s a greater depth in Android vs iOS) so much so that I&rsquo;ve given the iPad to my wife. It&rsquo;s not all sunshine and roses though (see the bad parts), but Android is heading in the right direction &ndash; all it needs is for Google to keep on polishing the rough edges and not to take their eyes off the ball.</p>

<p>Here are some comparative observations &ndash; things that stood out for me (please bear in mind that these are personal observations, this is not a formal product review):</p>

<p><strong>Thumb friendly UI</strong>:<br>
     The user interface is very &ldquo;thumb friendly&rdquo; &ndash; most of the time I hold the tablet in landscape mode with one hand either side using just my thumbs to execute commands &ndash; much more efficient that the iPad&rsquo;s &ldquo;hunt and peck&rdquo; UI. I don&rsquo;t know if this is serendipity or by design.</p>

<p><strong>Weight and size</strong>:<br>
     This is interesting, the Transformer is marginally heavier than the iPad 2 (680g vs 601g) but it feels lighter, probably because it&rsquo;s larger and less dense. The Transformer is also thicker (13mm vs 8.8mm), I thought this would be a biggy (most reviewers think it is) &ndash; I was wrong, for me there&rsquo;s no subjective difference.</p>

<p><strong>Batteries included</strong>:<br>
     The Transformer tablet has a built-in HDMI port and a Micro SD Card slot (iPad memory can&rsquo;t be expanded and you need an external adapter for HDMI connectivity).  The first accessories I brought for the Transformer were:</p>

<ul>
<li>A 5m HDMI cable so I could play tablet HD video and audio on my TV.</li>
<li>A 16GB Micro SD card for transferring and storing data.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cameras</strong>:<br>
     The 5M pixel rear camera produces <strong>much</strong> higher quality photos and movies than the iPad, there&rsquo;s just no comparison.</p>

<p><strong>Real keyboard</strong>:<br>
     The Transformer keyboard dock has a real keyboard (plus battery pack plus expansion ports) which turns the Transformer tablet into a Netbook PC and makes it useful for content creation. For me the lack of a real keyboard for the iPad was an increasing source of frustration (I know you can buy keyboards for the iPad but it&rsquo;s just not the same as having a beautifully integrated keyboard unit)</p>

<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>::<br>
The tablet lock/unlock slider should be on the left when inserting the tablet (I thought the slider icon meant _locked_ &ndash; it actually means <em>unlocked</em>).</p>

<p><strong>Bundled apps</strong>:<br>
     In my opinion all the Asus specific non-Google apps that come loaded on the Transformer are crapware.  I just wish manufacturers would ship vanilla operating systems without including other apps, or at the very least make them optional (there doesn&rsquo;t even seem to be any easy way to delete the bundled apps).</p>

<p><strong>The Android platform is relatively open</strong>:<br>
     The freedom to choose and create software without the platform vendor&rsquo;s permission is important to me &ndash; Apple&rsquo;s totalitarian control over iPad software installation and distribution is an unpalatable dead end.</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s missing</strong>:<br>
     At the moment I&rsquo;m mostly using the Transformer without the keyboard dock and what I miss most is the iPad Smart Cover &ndash; wandering around holding the Transformer in one hand with my fingers on the glass screen doesn&rsquo;t feel right and there&rsquo;s a constant nagging awareness of always having to be careful to protect the glass screen.</p>

<p><strong>The bad parts</strong>:<br>
     In a word <em>software</em> (my unit is running Android 3.2).</p>

<ul>
<li>Number one problem: The browser is appallingly slow on JavaScript heavy sites (try the <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/">jQuery mobile</a> demos). I also tried FireFox, Opera and Dolphin &ndash; in all three cases the stability and usability was worst than the Android browser. I don&rsquo;t know if this is specific to the Transformer or not (see <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=17353">Issue 17353: Honeycomb 3.1: Slow web browser performance on websites with a lot of JavaScript</a>. This is frustrating because the tabbed Android browser has a better UI and many more features than the iPad&rsquo;s browser.</li>
<li>Your TV HDMI inputs may or may not work with the tablet HDMI output. My Philips 42 inch LCD TV didn&rsquo;t connect when plugged into the Transformer, it does not support the tablet&rsquo;s 1280x800 output. I took the Transformer down to a local TV shop tried two 42 inch LCD TVs: it worked on a Sony but not an LG. <a href="http://forums.bit-tech.net/showpost.php?p=2637974&amp;postcount=83">This post</a> suggest the problem is a software limitation a the moment: &ldquo;Tegra 2 supports 1080p output over HDMI, but right now the product is limited to 1280 x 800 output over HDMI&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
