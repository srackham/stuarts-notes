<div class="sidebar"><h5>Update December 2013: An easier way to merge snapshots</h5>
<p>Verified this technique with VirtualBox 4.3.4.</p>
<p>VirtualBox has come along since I fist posted this article back in
2008 (Version 2.0.4) -- the latest version of VirtualBox (4.1.2) adds
a <em>Clone</em> command which largely renders the techniques described below
redundant and hugely simplifies matters (although they will still be
useful if you are interested in fine-grain snapshot management).</p>
<p>Here's the procedure to merge and compact all the snapshots to a new
VM containing a single VDI file:</p>
<ol><li>Optionally rename the VM so you can reuse its current name for cloned VM (you
  can change the VM name from the <em>Basic</em> tab of the <em>General</em> settings).</li><li>Right-click on the VM and run the <em>Clone...</em> command:<ul><li>If you opted for step 1, set the name to the VM's original name.</li><li>Accept the remaining defaults i.e. do not <em>Reinitialize the MAC
    address</em>; Clone type: <em>Full clone</em>; Snapshots: <em>Current machine
    state</em>.</li></ul></li><li>Take a snapshot of the cloned VM (a roll-back checkpoint and to
  minimize incremental backups)).</li><li>Start the new (cloned) VM and run precautionary disk checks
  (<em>chkdsk</em> or <em>fsck</em>).</li><li>Optionally delete the old VM (right-click on the VM and run the
  <em>Remove...</em> command). If you select the <em>Remove Only</em> option the old
  VM will be left on disk and you can restore it later using the the
  <em>Machine-&gt;Add...</em> command.</li></ol><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: After cloning Windows 8 I noticed a couple of (seemly benign
oddities):</p>
<ol><li>The first time the clone was started Windows 8 displayed the
  introduction to Windows 8 that you get when you first login.</li><li>Opening a Microsoft Office 2010 or  2013 for the first time on the
  clone triggered the Microsoft Office software activation wizard.</li></ol></div>
<div class="sidebar"><h5>Problems with 64-bit Windows 7 Guests with .vdmk disks</h5>
<p>This note is off-topic but it may be of help to anyone experiencing
this problem (sorry, I don't have a solution, apart from <em>don't put
64-bit Windows VMs into <code>.ova</code> files</em>).</p>
<p>After importing a <code>.ova</code> (Virtual Applicance) that had been previously
exported from VirtualBox I experienced Windows chkdsk errors after
creating a snapshot. The chkdsk problems seemed to change with each
chkdsk, the problems seemed to snowball. Here are the circumstances
under which I was able replicate this problem (I didn't try any other
scenarios):</p>
<ul><li>Window 7 64-bit Intel i5 host and Windows 7 64-bit (Intel i7)
  host.</li><li>Only Windows 7 64-bit guests (XP, Vista and Win7 32-bit guests are
  all fine).</li><li>After the first snapshot has been added.</li><li>VirtualBox 4.0.8 and 4.1.2.</li></ul></div>
<p>The techniques described in this article were tested on a Windows XP
Pro SP2 host operating system using VirtualBox version 2.0.4.  The
details may vary if you use a Linux or some other host OS.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Cloning and copying VirtualBox VMs is not as straight forward or
obvious as it is with VMWare Desktop and this subject has created a
lot of confusion in the support forums. This is because:</p>
<ul><li>There is no single VirtualBox command for VM cloning.</li><li>The documentation is vague.</li><li>A couple of the VirtualBox commands are poorly named.</li></ul><p>The good news is that the underlying technology is just great and with
a little understanding copying and cloning VMs is quite easy.</p>
<p>This article explains how to copy an existing VM containing an
installed and configured guest OS.  Before starting it helps to have a
basic understanding of VirtualBox virtual machines.</p>
<h2>Virtual Machines</h2>
<p>A VirtualBox VM consists of three parts:</p>
<ol><li>One or more virtual hard disk image files (VDI files).</li><li>Zero or more Snapshots (also VDI files).</li><li>XML configuration files defining the VM (virtual hardware
  parameters).</li></ol><h2>Snapshots</h2>
<ul><li>A snapshot bookmarks the state of the VM (specifically the VM file
  system) at the point in time the snapshot is made.</li><li>You return to a previous snapshot by deleting the current state and
  all newer snapshots.</li><li>When you create a snapshot, changes to the file system accumulate in
  the current snapshot file, older snapshot files and disk image files
  are effectively read-only.</li><li>If there are no snapshots the VM's disk image file accumulates file
  system changes just like normal disks -- the VM's <em>Current State</em> is
  merged into the disk image automatically when you close the VM.</li></ul><p>With respect to copying the important thing to understand about
snapshots is that there is no easy way to copy them, so if your source
VM has any snapshot information that you want to copy you first need
to merge the snapshot(s) into the source VM's disk images.</p>
<h2>Copying a Virtual Machine</h2>
<p>Here's an outline of the copy process:</p>
<ol><li>If the source VM has any snapshot information that you want to copy
  you first need to merge the snapshot(s) into the source VM's disk
  image files.</li><li>Make a clone the source VM's disk image file(s).</li><li>Create a new VM and attach the cloned disk image file(s).</li></ol><p>Here are the details:</p>
<h3>Merge source snapshots</h3>
<p>Here's how to merge the source snapshots to the source disk image VDI
file (skip this step if you source VM doesn't have any snapshots).</p>
<ol><li>If the source VM is running close it.</li><li>From the <em>VirtualBox</em> window select the source VM then click the
  <em>Snapshots</em> tab.</li><li>If you want to include the current state of the disk in the merge
  save it as a snapshot by selecting the <em>Current State</em> then
  executing the <em>Take Snapshot (Ctrl+Shift+S)</em> command.</li><li>Select the most recent snapshot you want to include in the target VM
  and execute the <em>Discard Snapshot (Ctrl+Shift+D)</em> command. This
  merges the snapshot file into it's parent VDI file (snapshot or base
  disk).</li><li>Repeat the previous step, working your way down the snapshot list
  until the oldest snapshot has  been merged into the base VDI.</li></ol><p>The VirtualBox snapshot commands are poorly named, in particular the
inconsistent and confusing use of the word <em>Discard</em>:</p>

</tr>

<h3>Clone or copy the source disk image</h3>
<p>At this point the entire state of the source VM that we want to copy
is contained in the disk image VDI file.</p>
<p>To avoid confusion I use the term <em>copying</em> to refer to copying a VM
to different host machine and the term <em>cloning</em> to refer to creating
a copy on the same host.</p>
<p class="Copying to another host machine">If you want to create a copy on another host machine you simply copy
the disk image to the new host.</p>
<ol><li>If the source VM is running close it.</li><li>Copy the source disk image to the VirtualBox VDI directory on the
  target host machine.  You'll normally find the source disk image in
  the VirtualBox VDI directory (the standard VDI location on Windows
  hosts is <code>C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;username&gt;\.VirtualBox\VDI</code>).</li></ol><p>Once you've copied the disk image you need to register it with
VirtualBox on the target host machine:</p>
<ol><li>From the <em>VirtualBox</em> window select <em>File-&gt;Virtual Disk Manager
  (Ctrl+D)</em> menu command.</li><li>Press the <em>Add</em> button and select the copied disk image file.</li></ol><p class="Creating a clone on the same host machine">Use the <code>VBoxManage</code> command-line utility the <code>clonevdi</code> command
option to clone and register the disk image (you can't just copy the
disk image to the same host machine because the disk UUID will
conflict with the source disk image):</p>
<ol><li>Open a Command Prompt window on the host machine.</li><li>Change to the VirtualBox VDI directory (normally <code>C:\Documents and
  Settings\&lt;username&gt;\.VirtualBox\VDI</code>).</li><li>Now run the <code>VBoxManage</code> command with the <code>clonevdi</code> command option.
  The following example transcript shows the creation of a copy of
  <code>Ubuntu 8.04.vdi</code> named <code>Ubuntu 8.04 clone.vdi</code> and registers the
  new disk:<pre><code>C:\Documents and Settings\srackham\.VirtualBox\VDI&gt; "C:\Program
Files\Sun\xVM VirtualBox\VBoxManage.exe" clonevdi "Ubuntu 8.04.vdi"
"Ubuntu 8.04 clone.vdi" VirtualBox Command Line Management Interface

0%...10%...20%...30%...40%...50%...60%...70%...80%...90%...100%

C:\Documents and Settings\srackham\.VirtualBox\VDI&gt;</code></pre>
</li></ol><p>My experience is that merging snapshots into a single base VDI saves a
lot of space (a Windows XP guest with 5 snapshots shrank from 8.6GB to
3.7GB) but defragging the drive and then running the <code>VBoxManage</code>
<code>modifyvdi compact</code> command didn't appear to regain any disk space in
either Windows XP or Vista.</p>
<h3>Create a new virtual machine</h3>
<p>There is no command to copy a VM so we create a new VM and attach our
copied disk to it:</p>
<ol><li>From the <em>VirtualBox</em> window select <em>Machine-&gt;New... (Ctrl+N)</em> menu
  command.</li><li>Work your way through the <em>Create New Virtual Machine</em> wizard till
  you get to the <em>Virtual Hard Disk</em> page then press the <em>Existing...</em>
  (not the <em>New...</em>) button and select the disk image VDI file that you
  previously cloned or copied.</li></ol><p>That's it, you should now be able to start and run your new VM.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: Try not to be tempted to edit the VirtualBox XML
configuration files manually -- the files are interrelated and making
changes manually is not as easy as it looks (I'm talking from
experience here) -- best to use the VirtualBox commands instead.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Although I have not tried, it should be relatively easy to automate
the copying and cloning procedures by scripting the powerful
VirtualBox <code>VBoxManage</code> command.</p>
