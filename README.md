# Stuart's Notes

This is my (Stuart Rackham's) personal blog.

- Hosted on Github at https://srackham.github.io/stuarts-notes/
- Built with [hindsite](https://github.com/srackham/hindsite)

## History
- Apr-2018: Ported the blog to Hindsite and hosted the Hindsite-generated blog
  on Github.
- Dec-2014: Ported the blog pages to Markdown and website generation to Hugo.
  Hosted the Hugho-generated blog on my ISP server. Previously the blog was
  hosted on [WordPress.com](https://srackham.wordpress.com/).
- 14-Mar-2022: Status: 41 posts spanning from 2008 to 2015. They are all related to Web
  and software development and most are now well out of date.


## Implementation notes
- The build directory is `./docs` (rather than the default Hindsite `./build`
  directory) because that's the easiest way to publish project documentation on
  Github. See:
